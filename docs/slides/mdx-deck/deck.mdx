# onebox-rs
### High-performance, secure internet bonding
<p>A presentation by Jules</p>

---

## The Problem

- Low Bandwidth
- Poor Reliability
- Lack of Redundancy
- High Cost of dedicated lines

---

## The Solution: onebox-rs

A Rust-based internet bonding solution that aggregates multiple internet connections into a single, resilient virtual connection.

---

## Features

<Appear>
  <p>Internet Bonding: Combine multiple WAN connections for increased bandwidth.</p>
  <p>Seamless Failover: Automatic failover when connections drop, with zero packet loss.</p>
  <p>End-to-End Encryption: ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption for all tunnel traffic.</p>
  <p>High Performance: Built with Rust and Tokio for minimal CPU overhead.</p>
</Appear>

---

## Architecture

---

### Client (`onebox-client`)
- Runs on Linux-based single-board computers (e.g., Raspberry Pi)
- Creates a TUN interface to capture all outgoing traffic
- Distributes packets across multiple connections

---

### Server (`onebox-server`)
- Runs on a cloud VPS with a public IP
- Receives encrypted packets from clients
- Reassembles packets and forwards them to the internet

## Technical Details

- Language: Rust
- Async Runtime: Tokio
- Protocol: Custom UDP-based protocol
- Encryption: ChaCha20-Poly1305
- Configuration: TOML

## Future Work

<Appear>
  <p>Web Dashboard: A simple web interface for real-time monitoring and configuration.</p>
  <p>Advanced Bonding Modes: Implement different policies, such as "reliability first" or "cost-aware".</p>
  <p>WireGuard Integration: Explore using WireGuard as the underlying transport.</p>
  <p>Cross-Platform Client: Expand client support to other operating systems like macOS and Windows.</p>
