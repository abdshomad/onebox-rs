# onebox-rs
### High-performance, secure internet bonding
<p>A presentation by Jules</p>

???
This is the title slide of the presentation.

---
## The Problem

- Low Bandwidth
- Poor Reliability
- Lack of Redundancy
- High Cost of dedicated lines

???
Here we outline the problems that onebox-rs aims to solve.

---
## The Solution: onebox-rs

A Rust-based internet bonding solution that aggregates multiple internet connections into a single, resilient virtual connection.

---
## Features

---
### Internet Bonding
Combine multiple WAN connections (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Cellular) for increased bandwidth.

---
### Seamless Failover
Automatic failover when connections drop, with zero packet loss.

---
### End-to-End Encryption
ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption for all tunnel traffic.

---
### High Performance
Built with Rust and Tokio for minimal CPU overhead.

---
## Architecture

---
### Client (`onebox-client`)
- Runs on Linux-based single-board computers (e.g., Raspberry Pi)
- Creates a TUN interface to capture all outgoing traffic
- Distributes packets across multiple connections

---
### Server (`onebox-server`)
- Runs on a cloud VPS with a public IP
- Receives encrypted packets from clients
- Reassembles packets and forwards them to the internet

---
## Technical Details

- Language: Rust
- Async Runtime: Tokio
- Protocol: Custom UDP-based protocol
- Encryption: ChaCha20-Poly1305
- Configuration: TOML

---
## Future Work

---
### Web Dashboard
A simple web interface (served locally by the client) for real-time monitoring and configuration.

---
### Advanced Bonding Modes
Implement different policies, such as "reliability first" or "cost-aware".

---
### WireGuard Integration
Explore using WireGuard as the underlying transport.

---
### Cross-Platform Client
Expand client support to other operating systems like macOS and Windows.
