# onebox-rs Motion One Animation Example

This directory contains a proof-of-concept animation of the `onebox-rs` system architecture, created using the [Motion One](https://motion.dev/) JavaScript library.

## How to View

Because this is an interactive HTML/JavaScript animation, it cannot be viewed directly in GitHub's Markdown renderer.

To view the animation, please follow these steps:
1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the `docs/diagrams/motion/` directory.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

The animation will play automatically when you open the file.
