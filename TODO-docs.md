# TODO for docs web UI

## Plan

1.  Create `TODO-docs.md` to track progress.
2.  Explore the `docs` directory to understand file types.
3.  Create a basic `index.html` in the `docs` folder to act as the UI.
4.  Write JavaScript to list the files in the `docs` directory.
5.  Style the page with CSS.
6.  Set up a simple web server to serve the `docs` directory.
